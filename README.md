OpenCensus Go is a Go implementation of OpenCensus, a toolkit for
collecting application performance and behavior monitoring data.
Currently it consists of three major APIs: tags, stats, and tracing.

This project is still at a very early stage of development and
a lot of the API calls are in the process of being changed and
might break your code in the future.


TODO: Add a link to the language independent OpenCensus doc when it is available.

## Installation
To install this package, you need to install Go and setup your Go workspace on your computer. The simplest way to install the library is to run:

```
$ go get -u github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-go/...
```

## Prerequisites
OpenCensus libraries require Go 1.8 or later as it uses the convenience function sort.Slice(...) introduced in Go 1.8.

## Tags API

### To create/retrieve a key
A key is defined by its name. To use a key a user needs to know its name and type (currently only keys of type string are supported. Later keys of type int64 and bool will be supported). Calling CreateKeyString(...) multiple times with the same name returns the same key.

Create/retrieve key:

```go
if key1, err := tags.CreateKeyString("keyNameID1"); err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

### To create a set of tags associated with keys
TagSet is a set of tags. The following code demonstrates how to create a new TagSet from scratch:

```go
tsb := NewTagSetBuilder(nil)
tsb.InsertString(key1, "foo value")
tsb.UpdateString(key1, "foo value2")
tsb.UpsertString(key2, "bar value")
tagsSet := tsb.Build()
```

The methods on Builder can be chained.

To create a new TagSet from an existing tag set oldTagSet:

```go
oldTagSet := ...
tsb := NewTagSetBuilder(oldTagSet)
tsb.InsertString(key1, "foo value")
tsb.UpdateString(key1, "foo value2")
tsb.UpsertString(key2, "bar value")
newTagSet := tsb.Build()
```

### To add or modify a TagSet in a context
Add tags to a context for propagation to downstream methods and downstream rpcs:
To create a new context with the tags. This will create a new context where all the existing tags in the current context are deleted and replaced with the tags passed as argument.
```go
newTagSet  := ...
ctx2 := tags.NewContext(ctx, newTagSet)
```
Create a new context keeping the old tag set and adding new tags to it, removing specific tags from it, or modifying the values fo some tags. This is just a matter of getting the oldTagSet from the context, apply changes to it, then create a new  context with the newTagSet.
```go
oldTagSet := tags.FromContext(ctx)
newTagSet := tags.NewTagSetBuilder(oldTagSet).InsertString(key1, "foo value").
    UpdateString(key1, "foo value2").
    UpsertString(key2, "bar value").
    Build()
ctx2 := tags.NewContext(ctx, newTagSet)
```

## Stats API

### To create/retrieve/delete a measure

Create and load measures with units:

```go
// returns a *MeasureFloat64
mf, err := stats.NewMeasureFloat64("/my/float64/measureName", "some measure", "MBy")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
mi, err := stats.NewMeasureInt64("/my/otherName", "some other measure", "1")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

Retrieve measure by name:

```go
mf, err := stats.FindMeasure("/my/float64/measureName")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
mi, err := stats.FindMeasure("/my/otherName")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

Delete measure (this can be useful when replacing a measure by another measure with the same name):

```go
if err := stats.DeleteMeasure(mf); err != nil {
    // handle error
}
if err := stats.DeleteMeasure(mi); err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

### To create an aggregation type
Currently only 2 types of aggregations are supported. The AggregationCount is used to count the number of times a sample was recorded. The AggregationDistribution is used to provide a histogram of the values of the samples.

```go
histogramBounds := []float64 { -10, 0, 10, 20}
agg1 := stats.NewAggregationDistribution(histogramBounds)
agg2 := stats.NewAggregationCount()
```

### To create an aggregation window
Currently only 3 types of aggregation windows are supported. The WindowCumulative is used to continuously aggregate the data received. The WindowSlidingTime to aggregate the data received over the last specified time interval. The NewWindowSlidingCount to aggregate the data received over the last specified sample count.
Currently all aggregation types are compatible with all aggregation windows. Later we might provide aggregation types that are incompatible with some windows.

```go
duration := 10 * time.Second
precisionIntervals := 5
wnd1 := stats.NewWindowSlidingTime(duration, precisionIntervals)

lastNSamples := 100
precisionSubsets := 10
wnd2 := stats.NewWindowSlidingCount(lastNSamples, precisionSubsets)

wn3 := stats.NewWindowCumulative()
```

### To create/register a view

TODO: define "view" (link to the spec).

Create a view:

```go
myView1 := stats.NewView("/my/int64/viewName", "some description", []tags.Key{key1, key2}, mf, agg1, wnd1)
myView2 := stats.NewView("/my/float64/viewName", "some other description", []tags.Key{key1}, mi, agg2, wnd3)
```

Register view:

```go
if err := stats.RegisterView(myView1); err != nil {
  // handle error
}
if err := stats.RegisterView(myView2); err != nil {
  // handle error
}
```

TODO: distinguish "create" and "register". Why do they need to be separate?

Retrieve view by name:

```go
myView1, err := stats.GetViewByName("/my/int64/viewName")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
myView2, err := stats.GetViewByName("/my/float64/viewName")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

Unregister view:

```go
if err := stats.UnregisterView(myView1); err != nil {
    // handle error
}
if err := stats.UnregisterView(myView2); err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

### To subscribe/unsubscribe to a view's collected data
Once a subscriber subscribes to a view, its collected date is reported at a regular interval. This interval is configured system wide.

Subscribe to a view:

```go
c1 := make(c chan *stats.ViewData)
if err := stats.SubscribeToView(myView1, c1); err != nil {
    // handle error
}
c2 := make(c chan *stats.ViewData)
if err := stats.SubscribeToView(myView2, c2); err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

Unsubscribe from a view:

```go
if err := stats.UnsubscribeFromView(myView1, c1); err != nil {
    // handle error
}
if err := stats.UnsubscribeFromView(myView2, c2); err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

Configure/modify the default interval between reports of collected data. This is a system wide interval and impacts all views. The default interval duration is 10 seconds. Trying to set an interval with a duration less than a certain minimum (maybe 1s) should have no effect.

```go
d := 20 * time.Second
stats.SetReportingPeriod(d)
```

### To force/stop data collection for on-demand retrieveal
Even if a view is registered, if it has no subscriber no data for it is collected. In order to retrieve data on-demand for view, either the view needs to have at least 1 subscriber or the libray needs to be instructed explicitly to collect collect data for the desired view.

```go
// To explicitly instruct the library to collect the view data for an on-demand
// retrieval, StopForcedCollection should be used.
if err := stats.ForceCollection(myView1); err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// To explicitly instruct the library to stop collecting the view data for the
// on-demand retrieval StopForcedCollection should be used. This call has no
// impact on subscriptions, and if the view still has subscribers, the data for
//  the view will still keep being collected.
if err := stats.StopForcedCollection(myView1); err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

### To record usage/measurements
Recording usage can only be performed against already registered measure
and their registered views. Measurements are implicitly tagged with the
tags in the context:

```go
mi.Record(ctx, 1)
mf.Record(ctx, 5.6)
stats.Record(ctx, mi.M(4), mf.M(10.5))
```

### To retrieve collected data for a View

```go
// assuming c1 is the channel that was used to subscribe to myView1
go func(c chan *stats.ViewData) {
    for vd := range c {
        // process collected stats received.
    }
}(c1)

// Use RetrieveData to pull collected data synchronously from the library. This
// assumes that at least 1 subscriber to myView1 exists or that
// stats.ForceCollection(myView1) was called before.
rows, err := stats.RetrieveData(myView1)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
for _, r := range rows {
    // process a single row of type *stats.Row
}
```

## Tracing API
TODO: update the doc once tracing API is ready.
