// An distribution aggregation may contain a histogram of the values in the
// population. The bucket boundaries for that histogram are described
// by DistributionAggregation slice. This defines length+1 buckets.
//
// If length >= 2 then the boundaries for bucket index i are:
//
//     [-infinity, bounds[i]) for i = 0
//     [bounds[i-1], bounds[i]) for 0 < i < length
//     [bounds[i-1], +infinity) for i = length
//
// If length is 0 then there is no histogram associated with the
// distribution. There will be a single bucket with boundaries
// (-infinity, +infinity).
//
// If length is 1 then there is no finite buckets, and that single
// element is the common boundary of the overflow and underflow buckets.
